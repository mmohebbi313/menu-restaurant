This project is a modern and responsive restaurant menu web application developed by Mohammad Mohebi using React.js. It showcases a list of food items in a clean and user-friendly interface. The project was built as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate my skills in frontend development, responsive UI design, and dynamic filtering functionality.
